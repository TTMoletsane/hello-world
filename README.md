# hello-world
Im a non-tech startup founder of PropTech business, so taking the coding exercise to understand programming and to understand my team a bit better.
Im South African based and hope this platform will expose me to this new world.
Im all about commercialising solutions and firm believe that deployment of apps should be about speed of implementation than pursuit of technical perfections.
In brief, tech should bring about efficiencies
